# FIF
Face Information Fusion Program

This application is used to combine the face biometrics of a person and RSA provided keys (i.e) Public key and private key, to a matrix
and applies several functions to the matrix in order to obtain a single vector(key) from the matrix. This key is very much encrypted and 
can be used for security purposes.
